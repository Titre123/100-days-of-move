## 100 Days of Move Challenge

Welcome to the 100 Days of Move Challenge! This initiative is crafted to guide developers through a comprehensive learning experience with the Move programming language, focusing on building decentralized applications on Move-based blockchains like Movement and Aptos.

| Day   | Project                | Description                                                |
|-------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Day 1 | Hello Blockchain       | Introduced debug::print() for logging "Hello, Blockchain!" to understand module creation. |

| Day 2 | Structs and Data Modeling | Learn how to define and use structs for modeling data in Move. Example: Create a Book struct and a Library module with basic book management. |
| Day 3 | Resources and Ownership | Understand Move's resource model and ownership rules. Example: Create a Coin resource and a Wallet module to manage coins. |
| Day 4 | Capabilities and Access Control | Learn about resource capabilities like store, key, and drop. Example: Create an AdminControl module to restrict certain actions to administrators. |
| Day 5 | Constants and Literals | Learn how to define and use constants and literals. Example: Create a Bank module with constant transaction fees and minimum deposit limits. |
| Day 6 | Modules and Functions | Learn about Move modules and how to define public and private functions. Example: Extend the Library module to add functions like add_book and remove_book. |
| Day 7 | Addresses and Global Storage | Learn how addresses work in Move and their role as unique identifiers. Example: Use addresses to store and retrieve resources. Introduce move_to, borrow_global, and borrow_global_mut. |
| Day 8 | Error Handling | Use abort and error codes to handle invalid operations. Example: Add error handling to the Wallet module for scenarios like insufficient balance. |
| Day 9 | Events | Log significant blockchain actions using Event. Example: Emit events for coin deposits and withdrawals in the Wallet module. |
| Day 10 | Vectors | Work with the vector data structure for dynamic collections. Example: Create a module to manage a list of user scores and implement functions to find the top scores. |
| Day 11 | Tables and Maps | Learn about table and map for key-value storage. Example: Build a UserRegistry module to store user profiles keyed by account address. |
| Day 12 | Generics and Smart Vectors | Explore generics for reusable code and smart_vector for enhanced vector functionality. Example: Create a ResourceVault<T> module using generics and smart vectors to manage dynamic resources. |
| Day 13 | Storage in Accounts | Learn how to store and access resources in user accounts. Example: Store a Profile resource in an account and allow account-specific updates. |
| Day 14 | Unit Testing | Dive into the Move testing framework and write tests for your modules. Example: Write unit tests for the Library, Wallet, and UserRegistry modules, covering both positive and negative cases. |
| Day 15 | Combining Data Structures | Build a complex module combining vector, table, and map. Example: Create a MarketPlace module where items are stored in a table, user inventories are managed with a map, and transactions are logged in a vector. |
| Day 16 | Scripts and Modules | Explore how Move scripts interact with modules for off-chain operations. Example: Write a script to interact with the MarketPlace module to list items and transfer ownership. |
| Day 17 | Token Standards | Discuss the importance of token standards in blockchain development. Explore fungible asset standards and digital asset standards like NFTS. Example: Create a simple fungible token contract and a non-fungible token contract to illustrate the differences and use cases. |
| Day 18 | Move Prover Basics | Learn about the Move Prover for formal verification. Example: Write specifications to verify the correctness of the Wallet module. |
| Day 19 | Dynamic Resource Control | Explore advanced resource control techniques in Move. Example: Build a DynamicAccess module that dynamically grants and revokes permissions to resources. |
| Day 20 | Final Project - Comprehensive Module | Combine all the concepts from previous days into a single advanced module. Example: Create a decentralized crowdfunding platform where users can create projects, contribute funds, and receive rewards. |
