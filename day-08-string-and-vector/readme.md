# Introduction to Move's Advanced Data Structures

As blockchain applications evolve and scale, developers need more sophisticated tools for managing growing datasets efficiently. While basic data structures like vectors and simple maps work well for smaller applications, they often become bottlenecks when handling larger-scale operations.

Move addresses these challenges through advanced data structures like Smart Vectors, Tables, and Simple Maps. These structures are specifically designed to optimize gas costs, improve performance, and handle large-scale data management effectively. Each structure offers unique advantages:

- **Smart Vectors**: Optimized for large datasets through a bucket system, providing efficient scaling and reduced gas costs
- **Tables**: Designed for direct key-value access with efficient storage management
- **Simple Maps**: Perfect for in-memory operations and temporary data storage

Understanding these data structures and their appropriate use cases is crucial for building efficient and scalable blockchain applications. The following documentation provides a comprehensive guide to implementing and utilizing these powerful tools in your Move projects.
